## Current Sprint: Developer Experience

### Navigation Architecture

- ✅ Implement user type detection (client vs developer)
- ✅ Smart redirection based on user role:
  - Developers automatically go to `/developer` dashboard
  - Clients automatically go to `/home`
- ✅ Session validation with redirect to login when needed

### Developer Dashboard Implementation

- ✅ Design and implement Developer Dashboard with Neobrutalist style
- ✅ New requests tab shows all pending service requests
- ✅ Active jobs tab shows requests the developer has accepted
- ✅ Accept/Reject functionality for new requests
- ✅ Mark Complete functionality for active jobs
- ✅ Real-time notifications for new requests

### Service Request Flow

- ✅ Client creates service request
- ✅ Request stored in database with proper location formatting
- ✅ Request appears on Developer Dashboard
- ✅ Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions

## Recent Updates

1. **GitHub Repository Setup**
   - ✅ Created GitHub repository for the project
   - ✅ Pushed all code to the repository
   - ✅ Transferred repository ownership to Mwoyoungo
   - ✅ Updated local Git configuration to point to the new repository location

2. **Available Developer Filtering**
   - ✅ Modified Home component to only show developers who are available (availability_status is true)
   - ✅ Added visual indicator showing the number of available developers on the map
   - ✅ Removed proximity-based filtering in favor of availability-based filtering

## Next Steps

1. **Real-time Service Matching**
   - Implement `developers_within_distance` PostgreSQL function
   - Filter requests shown to developers based on proximity
   - Notify nearby developers when new request is created

2. **Developer Earnings Page**
   - Create earnings dashboard with charts
   - Show completed jobs and payment history
   - Add statistics and performance metrics

3. **Chat Implementation**
   - Build messaging interface between clients and developers
   - Use Supabase realtime for message delivery
   - Message notifications

## Technical Design Decisions

- **Authentication Flow:**
  - Login checks user_type and redirects to appropriate dashboard
  - Index page auto-redirects logged-in users based on role
  - All pages protected with session verification

- **Data Structure:**
  - Users table includes user_type field to distinguish clients from developers
  - Service requests include client_id, matched_developer_id fields
  - Service request status flows: pending → in_progress → completed/cancelled

- **UI Design:**
  - Consistent Neobrutalist style across all pages
  - Mobile-first approach with responsive design
  - Bold black borders, yellow accents, and geometric shapes
