# LOKAL-S Implementation Plan

## Current Status
Based on the `task.md` file, we've completed:
- ✅ Development environment setup
- ✅ Supabase backend configuration
- ✅ Authentication implementation
- ✅ Onboarding & profile management
- ✅ Routing setup
- ✅ Client main flow

## Immediate Focus: Verify and Fix Current Implementation

### 1. Service Request Creation Flow
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Status:** Needs validation
- **Actions:**
  - Verify `handleFindProvider` in `ServiceDetails.tsx` properly formats data for Supabase
  - Ensure location data is saved as PostgreSQL geography point: `POINT(longitude latitude)`
  - Confirm all required fields are included in the service request insertion
  - Add toast notifications for success/failure
  - Test end-to-end flow from service selection to database insertion

### 2. Service Request Management for Developers
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Status:** To be implemented
- **Actions:**
  - Create UI for developers to view incoming service requests
  - Implement accept/reject functionality
  - Update service status in Supabase when a developer accepts a request
  - Test notification to client when a developer accepts their request

### 3. Real-time Service Matching
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Status:** To be implemented
- **Actions:**
  - Implement the `developers_within_distance` PostgreSQL function in Supabase
  - Create matching algorithm based on location and service type
  - Update UI to show matching developers to clients
  - Test matching functionality with multiple accounts

## Testing Plan
For each task:
1. **Unit Testing:** Test individual components and functions
2. **Integration Testing:** Verify flow between components
3. **End-to-End Testing:** Test complete user journeys
4. **Database Validation:** Confirm data is properly stored in Supabase

## Development Approach
- Work on one task at a time
- Fully test each feature before moving to the next
- Update `task.md` to mark completed tasks
- Follow neobrutalist design guidelines from `context.md`
- Use Supabase for all backend functionality

## Next Steps After Core Functionality
1. Real-time communication implementation
2. Review and rating system
3. UI refinements and mobile responsiveness
4. Deployment preparation
